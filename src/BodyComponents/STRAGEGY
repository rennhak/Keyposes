Forearms verification
---------------------

1.      Data ordination
        
        Reduce dimensions of data for both forearms from
        4 x 3D points (forearms) == 12D -> 3D

        t(0):
        X1  X2  ... X12
        Y1  Y2  ... Y12
        Z1  Z2  ... Z12

        t(1):
        X1  X2  ... X12
        Y1  Y2  ... Y12
        Z1  Z2  ... Z12
      
        take upto t(150) ? ~ 1s



        o How much data loss?
        o Can we use PCA or do we need SPCA?

2.      On 3D data

        Estimate curvature
        Estimate desity


3.      What is questions...
          ... Turning motions
          ... Turning poses

4.      Turning motions Analysis
