These routines may have some of the following dependencies:

0) The routines are in a package "ZS".  This is of course optional,
you can simply comment out the ZS and use the routine inside
the default package if desired.

1) zlib.*  This contains some unimportant _assert calls.
You can either comment these out, or use the zlib.java and zliberror.java
linked below.

2) ZS.*
matrix.java contains routines to print matrices for debugging purposes.
These calls can be commented out, or you can use the matrix.java linked
below.

zmath.java has various small math routines (binomial and such).
Use the zmath.java linked below.

3) VisualNumerics.math.*.  
This ("jnl") was a free matrix library.  It is no longer available 
from VisualNumerics, but some old copies might be around.
I like it because it treats matrices as plain java [][] arrays
rather than inventing a matrix type with its possible overhead.

If you cannot find jnl, you will need to adapt these routines to use 
your own matrix library (just replace the *Matrix calls with your own).  
Some free/open source matrix libraries are Jama (search for it) 
or Matrix Toolkits for Java (http://rs.cipr.uib.no/mtj)

As of March 07, I was able to find the jnl library by searching online for
"jnl.jar" and "visualnumerics.jar".  It is included in the "synthetica"
package under the name visualnumerics.jar in the lib folder.
