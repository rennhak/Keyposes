Naming Scheme Convention for Directory
--------------------------------------

<Domain>/<Dance or Motion Name>/<Pattern>/<Speed>/<Cycle>/Dance.<extention>


<Domain>
  Name of the domain of motion data
  e.g. japanese, western, latin, etc.

<Dance or Motion Name>
  Name of the dance itself
  Note: Words are separated by an underscore
  e.g. Aizubandaisan, Jongara, etc.

<Pattern>
  Pattern of the motion (e.g. dancer dances in a circle)
  e.g. random, circle, square, etc.

<Speed>
  Speed of which the dance has been performed
  Note: Three digits with leading zeros in percent.
  e.g. 080, 100, 120

<Cycle>
  Dances consist of cycles of repeating motions.
  (e.g. Aizubandaisan has 8 important poses which is one cycle)
  First cycles are often bad because the dancer is not used to the dance yet, so motion capture data
  often features the same motion over and over multiple times consecutively.
  Note: Three digits with leading zeros
  e.g. 001, 002 etc.
