= Introduction

The GNU Scientific Library (((<GSL|URL:http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/>))) 
is a collection of routines for numerical computing. 
The routines have been written from scratch in C, and present a modern Applications 
Programming Interface (API) for C programmers, allowing wrappers to be 
written for very  high level languages. The source code is distributed 
under the GNU General Public License.

extension for GSL. This provides higher-level interfaces to the GSL functions.
