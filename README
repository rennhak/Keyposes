Poses as shown by the Dance Master Illustrations Segmentation
-------------------------------------------------------------

This project tries to extract "Keyposes" from Dance Motion Data based on VPM files via the MotionX
project. (http://github.com/rennhak/MotionX)

We are dealing with several concepts such as

  o Keyposes

    This term was coined by T. Shiratori and his collegues to describe important dance motions which
    occur when the hand and the foot end-effectors stop in conjunction with musical beat [1]. These
    motions are considered to be the essence of the dance from the viewpoint of importance.

  o Turning poses

    This term was coined by B. Rennhak and his collegues to describe the most important poses as
    shown in the dance master illustrations. These poses convey temporal importance as well as style
    and details for a complete dance reconstruction [2]. These motions are considered to be the
    essence of the dance from the viewpoint of a dance teacher.

  o Turning motions

    This term was coined by B. Rennhak and his collegues to describe the most characteristic
    trajectory representations of state to state intervalls of a given dance.

Libraries
---------

Libraries can be found in base/

They are not submodules but simple clones from the original source. Submodules seem to be not the
right solution.
