                              Version 0.2.2




WHAT IS THE POSES PROJECT ?

This project tries to extract important Poses from Dance Motion Data based on VPM files via the MotionX
project. (http://github.com/rennhak/MotionX)

We are dealing with several concepts such as

  o Keyposes

    This term was coined by T. Shiratori and his collegues to describe important dance motions which
    occur when the hand and the foot end-effectors stop in conjunction with musical beat [1]. These
    motions are considered to be the "essence" of the dance from the viewpoint of structure importance.

  o Turning poses

    This term was coined by B. Rennhak and his collegues to describe the most important poses as
    shown in the dance master illustrations. These poses convey temporal importance as well as style
    and details for a complete dance reconstruction [2]. These motions are considered to be the
    "essence" of the dance from the viewpoint of a dance teacher.

  o Turning motions

    This term was coined by B. Rennhak and his collegues to describe the most characteristic
    trajectory representations of state to state intervalls of a given dance.

Subprojects:

  Directory:    "src/BodyComponents"
  Description:  "Body components w/ middle arms and projection from 3D->2D"
  Keywords:     "Golden Section, Body components, vpm, projection, turning points"
  Dependencies:  MotionX->plugins->VPM ; http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/deep-clone/ (for marshal ; copy&pasted)
                  https://webfiles.colorado.edu/alken/www/gsl/ndlinear-1.0.tar.gz Ruby GSL etc.
  FIXME:         Change to MotionX XYAML interface.


Libraries:

Libraries can be found in base/

They are not submodules but simple clones from the original source. Submodules seem to be not the
right solution.

ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

    This Software was originally developed and tested on 32-bit x86 / SMP based PCs running on
    Ubuntu and Gentoo GNU/Linux 2.6.x. Other direct Linux and Unix derivates should be viable too as
    long as all dynamical linking dependencys are met. 


DOCUMENTATION


    A general developers API guide can be extracted from the Doxygen
    subdirectory which is able to generate HTML as well as PDF docs. Please refer to the
    [Rake|Make]file for additional information how to generate this documentation.


INSTALLING

    If you got this package as a packed tar.gz or tar.bz2 please unpack the contents in
    an appropriate folder e.g. ~/jokemachine/ and follow the supplied INSTALL or README
    documentation. Please delete or replace existing versions before unpacking/installing
    new ones.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    This package was developed and compiled under Gentoo GNU/Linux 2.6.x with the Ruby 1.8.x MRI
    interpreter.
