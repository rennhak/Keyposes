Keypose Segmentation
--------------------

This project tries to extract "Keyposes" from Dance Motion Data based on VPM files via the MotionX
project. (http://github.com/rennhak/MotionX)

The idea of Keyposes is as follows:

  A Dance consists of certain turning motions which define a dance. These turning motions are called
  "Keyposes". In order to program a robot we need to extract these keyposes. Keyposes are basically
  the essence of a dance.


Subprojects:

  Directory:    "src/BodyComponents"
  Description:  "Body components w/ middle arms and projection from 3D->2D"
  Keywords:     "Golden Section, Body components, vpm, projection, turning points"
  Dependencies:  MotionX->plugins->VPM ; http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/deep-clone/ (for marshal ; copy&pasted)
  FIXME:         Change to MotionX XYAML interface.


Libraries
---------

Libs can be found in base/
They are not submodules but simple clones from the original source. Submodules are evil(tm).
